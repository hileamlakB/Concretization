# Concretization

Lets concretize what has been abstracted for the sake of learning!!

The idea of concretization is a powerful tool when it comes to understanding already built systems.
How does a network work, how does a compiler work ... The question in the list goes on. To understand 
the answers for this questions one of the best way is to make a small version of the system. Like a
small network or small compiler. 

This is what this repository is about. Along my programming journey, I am making and also planing to make 
many concretizations. And when I do I would like others to use them too, that is why I documenting them. 
On top of that documenting helps me to recap what I may forget in the future so if you find any of this helpful 
don't forget to star this repository.

I publish the articles I write and the findings I make on Medium. And the links will be updated on this README file.
This repository will also contain all source codes, and other necessary files that might be mentioned in the blogs.

So far here are the articles I wrote.

1. [Concretization one level deeper: Implement your own strtok();](https://hileabuis.medium.com/concretization-one-level-deeper-to-strtok-377200343450?source=follow_footer---------0----------------------------)
2. [Database vs Warehouse: The analogy](https://hileabuis.medium.com/database-vs-warehous-the-analogy-54db1f5de5a5)
